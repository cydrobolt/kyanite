kyanite
=======

#####A server-side analytics app for PHP. Minimalistic, hackable, and lightweight. Kyanite is replacing one of my previous projects, HTrack.

####Features:

 - Record IP of each visitor
 - Record amount of visitors per day, and total
 - Unlike JS-based analytics systems, Kyanite is run on the server, and will record visits from all users, not just those that have JS enabled.
 - Add other users
 - More soon
